The problem is old - How to implement a multi-threaded, socket-based server that will let you read and write to the client (for example a telnet terminal.

There are several problems with constructing such a server:

   1. You have to use threads because otherwise clients will be queued up waiting for a connection.
   2. Many of the publically available examples (even some in some books) do not work for I/O servers. They are mostly developed around reading from a socket not writing to the socket as well. In our example we give a working read/write code example.
   3. You need to avoid race conditions when starting up a thread at times when connections are coming through thick and fast.

The code below will implement just such a server. It is intended for a head start, so is a template rather than a tutorial on how to write a server in Java. We have decided on port 4444 to listen on in the example, but you need to decide on a suitable port yourself.

The server will run, establishing connections from the port and echoing input received until it receives a line of input that is a full stop only ".".

Have fun!
